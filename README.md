# Code Refactor: Horiseon Webpage

## Description

An example webpage with legacy code that needed to be refactored to include modern coding conventions. The purpose of this project was to practice examining code and refactoring it in a way that makes it more accessible to current and future developers. While working on this project I have learned more about HTML semantic tags, tag attributes, and practiced using and tweaking CSS selectors while also maintaining the original purpose of the code. 

## Installation

## Usage

The webpage has been deployed and can be accessed [here]().

The webpage is fully functional and the clickable links within the header still point to their respective section. You can view the HTML via the Chrome Dev Tools which can be accessed by right-clicking the webpage in Google Chrome and clicking "Inspect". For legacy code changes, you can view a record of all changes made through the commits in the repository.

The webpage should look like the following:
